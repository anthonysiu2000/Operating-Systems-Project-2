Logic:
    Thread Functions:

    Scheduler:
            One of the arguments in settimer()/gettimer() involves the variable "which", which
        can have the value ITIMER_REAL, ITIMER_VIRTUAL, or ITIMER_PROF. Each of these values
        define when the timer decrements: in real time, when the process is executing, and
        when the process and system are executing. Because we want the time taken by the 
        thread for one quantum time, we will use the ITIMER_VIRTUAL value to decrement time 
        only when inside a thread.
