Logic:
    Thread Functions:
        myThreadCreate:
            In order to implement the create mythread API, We will follow the directions set
        in the instructions. We will first create a new thread control block, which will 
        contain the thread id, quantum time elapsed(qte), thread context, and thread status. 
        We will dynamically allocate memory for each control block.
            After setting thread id to the thread id given in the input, initializing status 
        to scheduled and setting qte to 0, we will create the thread context using the getcontext 
        and makecontext functions.
            After creating and allocating the thread control block, we will add the tcb onto
        the scheduler queue of tcbs. The scheduler will decide which thread to run and for how
        long. We do this simply by enqueueing the created tcb onto a previously 

    Scheduler:
        

        SetTimer:
            One of the arguments in settimer()/gettimer() involves the variable "which", which
        can have the value ITIMER_REAL, ITIMER_VIRTUAL, or ITIMER_PROF. Each of these values
        define when the timer decrements: in real time, when the process is executing, and
        when the process and system are executing. Because we want the time taken by the 
        thread for one quantum time, we will use the ITIMER_VIRTUAL value to decrement time 
        only when inside a thread.
